# NextDeal Logo Setup

## Adding the Logo Image

1. Save your NextDeal logo image as `nextdeal-logo.png` in this `public` folder
2. The logo should be a PNG file with a transparent background
3. Recommended size: At least 200px wide for best quality
4. The logo will automatically display in the navigation banner

## Current Logo Implementation

The logo is configured to:
- Display at height of 32px (h-8) in the navigation
- Fall back to text "NextDeal" if the image is not found
- Link to the home page when clicked

## File Location

Place your logo file at: `public/nextdeal-logo.png`

The image will be accessible at: `http://localhost:3000/nextdeal-logo.png`
