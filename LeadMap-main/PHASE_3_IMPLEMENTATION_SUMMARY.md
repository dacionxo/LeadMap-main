- Toggle button to enable/disable real-time updates
- User-scoped subscriptions for security

## Usage Examples

### Using the Enhanced Dashboard

```tsx
import EmailAnalyticsDashboard from '@/app/dashboard/marketing/components/EmailAnalyticsDashboard'

export default function AnalyticsPage() {
  return <EmailAnalyticsDashboard />
}
```

### Using Individual Components

import HealthMonitoring from '@/app/dashboard/marketing/components/HealthMonitoring'
import EngagementHeatmap from '@/app/dashboard/marketing/components/EngagementHeatmap'

// Use individually
<DeviceAnalytics mailboxId="mailbox-123" period="30d" />
<LocationAnalytics mailboxId="mailbox-123" period="30d" />
<HealthMonitoring mailboxId="mailbox-123" hours={24} />

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test device analytics with sample data
- [ ] Test location analytics (requires geolocation data)
- [ ] Test health monitoring with various health states
- [ ] Test engagement heatmap visualization
- [ ] Test real-time updates toggle
- [ ] Verify responsive design on mobile devices
- [ ] Test dark mode support
- [ ] Verify chart interactions (hover, tooltips)
- [ ] Test optimal send time recommendations
- [ ] Verify all API endpoints return correct data

## Known Limitations

1. **Location Data**: Requires IP geolocation service integration (placeholder in `device-parser.ts`)
2. **Real-time Performance**: Large datasets may cause performance issues with real-time updates
3. **Heatmap Data**: Requires sufficient historical data for accurate patterns

## Next Steps

Phase 3 is complete! Ready to proceed to:

- **Phase 4**: A/B Testing & Campaign Analytics (Tasks 6, 10, 16)
- **Phase 5**: Webhooks & API (Tasks 8, 20)

## Integration Notes

### Geolocation Service

To enable location analytics, integrate a geolocation service in `lib/email/device-parser.ts`:

```typescript
// Example with ipapi.co
export async function getLocationFromIp(ipAddress: string): Promise<LocationData | null> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://ipapi.co/${ipAddress}/json/`)
    const data = await response.json()
    
    return {
      country: data.country_name,
      city: data.city,
      timezone: data.timezone,
      latitude: data.latitude,
      longitude: data.longitude
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return null
  }
}
```

### Real-Time Configuration

Ensure Supabase Realtime is enabled:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Database → Replication
2. Enable replication for `email_events` table
3. Configure RLS policies if needed

## Notes

- All components use Recharts for consistent visualization
- Charts are fully responsive and mobile-friendly
- Dark mode is fully supported
- All components follow Mautic dashboard patterns
- Real-time updates are optional (toggle on/off)
- Location analytics requires geolocation service integration
